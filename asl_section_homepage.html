<p class="section-description">Vancro has worked hard to become a leader in in providing Interpreting services nationwide. We have a   primary focus on federal and govenment Interpreting needs. Always in consideration are our three stakeholders: the requester of services, the people who are utilizing the Interpreters and the Interpreters who are providing the service.  For Vancro to provide exceptional service, each stakeholder is considered. To that end, we have made quality assurance  and customer service integral in our Interpreter provision. This focus sets us apart from other agencies or companies that provide Interpreters. </p>

                    <p class="service-description">Vancro is a great company to work for. We are flexible and open to feedback. Most importantly  we honor your terms and conditions.
 If we cannot honor them, we will not offer to provide interpreting services. As an Interpreter working for Vancro, rest assured that our goal is to elevate our profession.  
We hire a local Program Manager to work on-site with the requestors and with local Interpreters at all of our locations.  Vancros executive team is a phone call away. As stated, 
we will not undercut expertise for profit.  Our aim is exceptional service. We will never ask interpreters to sign a non-compete. Vancro feels strongly that non-compete agreements 
do a disservice to the Deaf community and diminishes the autonomy of interpreters as private practitioners.  Rather, we want to be such a great place to work that your first preference is Vancro. </p>

                    <h4 class="service-title"><a href="">The Service Users</a></h4>
                    <p class="service-description">Vancro will work with you to secure your preferred Interpreters. 
We understand that preference lends to quality and preserves institutional knowledge that is incredibly valuable in the nuanced work that you do. For on-going requests, 
Vancro will build a roster of highly qualified Interpreters and will check in regularly to ensure that the Interpreting team is fitting your needs. We can provide additional 
training to the staff or to the Interpreting team if requested. Based on your feedback, we will create a Designated Interpreter Team (DIT) that will allow consistency in Interpreter provision. 
For one-time requests, Vancro takes advantage of that same roster to provide exceptional Interpreters. We do not base our model of Interpreter provision on first reply, 
first hired or the least expensive interpreter. We look for quality, content expertise, solid adherence to ethics, and to your Interpreter preference.  </p>

                    <p class="service-description">Vancros aim is to provide outstanding service to any requestor or government agency. We offer a complete package of services to ensure that you are 
getting exactly what you need. We always have a local Program Manager available to you and our responsibility is to ensure you are receiving the highest quality Interpreters. 
The ASL leadership team personally vets every Interpreter we hire.  We do not subscribe to a plug and play model of Interpreter placement where there is no quality assurance or feedback loop afforded to you.  
If there is something we could be doing differently or better, we want to know.</p>

                    <p class="service-description">Vancro recognizes the importance of supporting Interpreters and the Deaf Community. We are members of RID and NAD and are currently working on establishing an Internship program. Vancro is also looking into ways we can support the local communities where we have Interpreters working. Suggestions welcome!</p>
